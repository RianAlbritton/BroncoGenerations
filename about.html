<!--This is a brief history of Ford Bronco-->
    <div>
        <p class="fordblue">Ford came out with the Bronco in 1966.  It was marketed as the original “All Purpose Vehicle” and was titled as a Station Wagon as the term Sport Utility Vehicle had not been coined yet.  From 1966-1977, the Bronco had the same body style although there were several package options one could choose.  Each package had a uniqueness to suit the desires of the buyers.</p>
